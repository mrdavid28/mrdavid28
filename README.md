### Hi there 👋  My name is David, I'm 24 years old, and I live. In Poland, I'm learning different programming languages and getting to know different programming paradigms. In the future, I'd like to work as a programmer. I'm also interested in cryptocurrencies. Whoever you are, feel free to use my code.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elm, Yasm assembler, Javascript.
